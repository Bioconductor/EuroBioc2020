## Social media policy

Images and content from talks, workshops, and posters may be shared publicly through social media. Talks may be recorded by the organizers and published via the Bioconductor Youtube channel.

## Code of conduct

This code of conduct is adapted from the [Bioc2020 code of conduct](http://bioc2020.bioconductor.org/code_of_conduct). 

### The European Bioconductor conference aims to provide a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free environment

Bioconductor is built on the free and open exchange of scientific
ideas, and the contributions of our diverse user community. In this spirit, we are dedicated to providing a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of:

* gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
* intellectual position: approaches to data analysis, software preferences, coding style, scientific perspective, etc.

We do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying of conference participants in talks, workshops, poster sessions, group discussions, social activities, or online. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference with no refund, at the discretion of the conference organizers. 

### Examples of unacceptable harassment, intimidation, and bullying behavior

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Making comments, to an audience or personally, that belittle or demean another person
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Intimidation and bullying include, but are not limited to:

* Aggressive or browbeating behavior directed at someone during a public presentation
* Mocking or insulting another person’s intellect, work, perspective, or question/comment
* Making reference to someone’s gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or other personal attribute in the context of a scientific discussion
* Deliberately making someone feel unwelcome

### Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible, by reaching out to conference organizers (`laurent.gatto@uclouvain.be` or `charlotte.soneson@fmi.ch`). 

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.
