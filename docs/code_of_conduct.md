## Code of conduct

This on-line conference adopts the **[Bioconductor project-wide code
of conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/)**, and all
participants agree to abide by the Code of Conduct.

Below, we summarize the main points pertaining to this event, but
invite participants to familiarize themselves with the project-wide
code of conduct.


### The European Bioconductor conference aims to provide a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free environment

Bioconductor is built on the free and open exchange of scientific
ideas, and the contributions of our diverse user community. In this
spirit, we are dedicated to providing a supportive, collegial, and
harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of:

* gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
* intellectual position: approaches to data analysis, software
  preferences, coding style, scientific perspective, etc.

We do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying of conference
participants in talks, workshops, poster sessions, group discussions
or social activities. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
for any conference event. Conference participants violating these
rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the on-line conference, at
the discretion of the conference organizers.

### Examples of unacceptable harassment, intimidation, and bullying behavior

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Making comments, to an audience or personally, that belittle or
  demean another person
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Intimidation and bullying include, but are not limited to:

* Aggressive or browbeating behavior directed at someone during a
  public presentation
* Mocking or insulting another person’s intellect, work, perspective,
  or question/comment
* Making reference to someone’s gender, gender identity and
  expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
  body size, race, age, religion, or other personal attribute in the
  context of a scientific discussion
* Deliberately making someone feel unwelcome

### Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers
retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming
environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender
or expulsion from the on-line conference.

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or
with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the
environment hostile for any participants.

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please
report it as soon as possible, by reaching out to conference
organizers by email (`laurent.gatto@uclouvain.be` or
`charlotte.soneson@fmi.ch`), slack or the conference chat.

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and
cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your
report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about
what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as
respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support
you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone
who you are.

Participants can also make an anonymous or non-anonymous report via
the following link: https://tinyurl.com/bioccomplaint. It is a
free-form text box that will be forwarded to the Code of Conduct
Committee.
