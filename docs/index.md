## Group discussions

The group discussions will be based on a invited talk, and will give
the participants the opportunity to continue the discussion under the
moderation of the speaker and other experts present at the
conference. We have around 4 topics (see below); participants will
choose which group discussion to contribute to at the beginning of the second day.

The group discussion topics will be announced soon.

## Flashlight sessions

Flashlights are intended to be short presentations covering a single
topic e.g. a new package or a particular technical problem you have
encountered. Each talk has been allotted **8 minutes** and presenters
should aim for approximately 6 slides. The following rules will apply
in these sessions in order to keep things flowing:

- ...

Speakers, please share you slides with your session chair in the
tea/lunch break preceding your session. Presentations will be
transferred to a single computer to ensure the smooth running of the
session. It's safest to use a PDF.
